Weather Dashboard Application

This project is a simple Weather Dashboard application built using React. It allows users to enter a city name, fetch real-time weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API, and display the weather information along with interactive charts (Bar Chart and Pie Chart) based on the temperature and humidity data.

Features
Search by City: Enter a city name to fetch weather data.
Dynamic Chart Switching: Toggle between Bar Chart and Pie Chart to visualize temperature and humidity data.
Error Handling: Displays error messages if there's an issue fetching weather data.
Responsive Design: The application is designed to be responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
React
Axios for API requests
React ApexCharts for chart visualization
CSS for styling

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
